### Things to learn

1. [Next.js _api_ folder](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction)

## Frontend Technologies

We use the following tech stack in the frontend part of the project:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): We use TypeScript in all our web dev projects in Neno. this helps us to avoid type errors, write readable code, and maintain consistency throughout our codebase.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): The most popular JavaScript framework in the world. We majorly use React.js to build projects because it is powerful, fast, and backed by Facebook with a large community. Also, importantly, it is still very in active support and maintained by Facebook.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): We use Next.js for server-side rendering. Next.js makes it easy to build an SSR-enabled React.js app with almost zero configuration, yet maintaining the powerful features of React.js and highly performant.

## Backend Technologies

For the backend stack, we use:

- [REST APIs with Express.js](https://www.expressjs.com/): We use Express.js framework which is a back-end framework that runs on node.js to build fast scalable APi's.
- [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/): We use node js as our runtime.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): We use MySQL as our database and store all the data used in the app in a MySQL database located on planetscale.
- [PlanetScale](https://www.planetscale.com): **PlanetScale** is now the most scalable MySQL platform. And is what we use as the host of our MySQL database.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): We use prisma as our ORM.
